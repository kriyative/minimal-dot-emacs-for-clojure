This is a minimal .emacs/init.el to setup clojure-mode [1], CIDER-mode [2] and Paredit mode [3] for folks just starting out with Clojure development.

To get started:

- Clone this repo:

#+begin_src shell
  cd $HOME
  git clone https://github.com/kriyative/minimal-dot-emacs-for-clojure.git .emacs.d
#+end_src

- Start emacs
- Press the =y= key when prompted to confirm installing the =clojure-mode=, =CIDER= and =paredit= packages. This should only be on the first time these need to be installed
- Visit any Clojure project =deps.edn= file using the =C-x C-f= keybinding
- Start Clojure with =M-x cider-jack-in= (=M-x= means press the =Alt= or =Option= key and the =x= key simultaneously, and type in the =cider-jack-in= command at the prompt, and hit the =Enter= or =Return= key)
- If all goes well, the Clojure REPL should appear in a new window alongside =deps.edn=
